/**
 * @notice A basic guest list contract for testing.
 * @dev For a Vyper implementation of this contract containing additional
 * functionality, see https://github.com/banteg/guest-list/blob/master/contracts/GuestList.vy
 * The owner can invite arbitrary guests
 * A guest can be added permissionlessly with proof of inclusion in current merkle set
 * The owner can change the merkle root at any time
 * Merkle-based permission that has been claimed cannot be revoked permissionlessly.
 * Any guests can be revoked by the owner at-will
 * The TVL cap is based on the number of want tokens in the underlying vaults.
 * This can only be made more permissive over time. If decreased, existing TVL is maintained and no deposits are possible until the TVL has gone below the threshold
 * A variant of the yearn AffiliateToken that supports guest list control of deposits
 * A guest list that gates access by merkle root and a TVL cap

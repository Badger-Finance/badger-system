class UpgradeValidator:
    '''
    UpgradeValidator validates a sequence of snapshots taken of a contract's storage vars
    during the process of an upgrade. Normally, this is just before/after to ensure that
    the storage vars have not been affected by the upgrade. This may be extended in the future
    to perform more sophisticated validation.

    NB: OZ takes a more sophisticated approach to solve this problem (this is a js plugin) by crawling
    the AST and deriving the storage layout. We take the following more simplistic user defined varialble
    checking approach due to time constraints. Could be a future TODO project to port over the AST based approach
    and contribute back to brownie.
